# Project Summary: Mapping Fire Incidents in Australia

For my solo project, I explore the distribution of fire incidents across different regions of Australia using data from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2020/2020-01-07/readme.md). The dataset comprises of three CSV files: rainfall data, temperature data, and fire data for Australia and New Zealand. My primary focus is on analyzing the geographic distribution of fires in Australia using a choropleth map. To visualize this effectively, I supplement the TidyTuesday data with spatial boundary data that defines the major regions of Australia.



Before plotting the map, the fire dataset needed is cleaned and spatially aligned. Specifically, the fire data was transformed to match the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the Australian regional boundaries.
I aggregated the number of fire incidents per region, creating a new dataset that links each region to its total fire count. This summary data was then joined with the spatial boundaries dataset. 


Using the tmap package in R, I created a choropleth map with tm_shape() to visualize the spatial concentration of fires. The map reveals that New South Wales has the highest number of fires, standing out with the darkest fill on the choropleth.Other regions show significantly lower fire counts, often around one or very few incidents. To enhance user interaction and interpretability, I also created an interactive leaflet map. This allows users to hover or click on a region to view its name and fire count, and easily compare fire distribution across regions in a dynamic format.

Overall New South Wales emerges as the region with the highest fire activity.Other regions display relatively low and uniform fire occurrences.The combination of static and interactive maps provides a comprehensive and user friendly view of spatial fire patterns.
