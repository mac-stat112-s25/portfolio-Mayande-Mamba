title: "Univariate Viz"

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats) 
```


```{r}
# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```

```{r,fig.cap="This is a histogram for the elevation variable.", fig.alt= "This histogram shows the count in number of hikes at each elevation in the range of around 3200 to 5500"}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200, fill= "blue") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes") +
  ggtitle("Number of hikes per elevation") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))
```
