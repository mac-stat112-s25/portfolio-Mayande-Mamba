This includes data on the hike’s highest elevation (feet), vertical ascent (feet), length (miles), time in hours that it takes to complete, and difficulty rating. Open this data in a viewer, through the Environment tab or by typing View(hikes) in the console.\n\n# Import data\nhikes &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the pattern / trend of elevation of hiking trails?\nWhat is the relationship between a hike’s elevation and typical time it takes to summit / reach the top?\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\nLook at the plot below taken from a story reported by this New York Times article (html).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nSuppose that the article tried telling the story without using data viz, What would that story be like?\n\n\n\nBenefits of Visualization\n\nUnderstand what we’re working with from\n\nscales & typical outcomes, to\noutliers, i.e. unusual cases, to\npatterns & relationships\n\n\nRefine research questions & inform next steps of our analysis.\nCommunicate our findings and tell a story.\n\n6.2.2 Components of data graphics\nEXAMPLE 3\nData viz is the process of mapping data to different plot components. For example, in the NYT example above, the research team mapped data like the following (but with many more rows!) to the plot:\n\n\nobservation\ndecade\nyear\ndate\nrelative temp\n\n\n\n1\n2020-30\n2023\n1/23\n1.2\n\n\n2\n1940-60\n1945\n3/45\n-0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nWrite down step-by-step directions for using a data table like the one above to create the temperature visualization. A computer is your audience, thus be as precise as possible, but trust that the computer can find the exact numbers if you tell it where.\n\n\nCOMPONENTS OF GRAPHICS\nIn data viz, we essentially start with a blank canvas and then map data onto it. There are multiple possible mapping components. Some basics from Wickham (which goes into more depth):\n\na frame, or coordinate system\nThe variables or features that define the axes and gridlines of the canvas.\na layer\nThe geometric elements (e.g. lines, points) we add to the canvas to represent either the data points themselves or patterns among the data points. Each type of geometric element is a separate layer. These geometric elements are sometimes called “geoms” or “glyphs” (like heiroglyph!)\nscales\nThe aesthetics we might add to geometric elements (e.g. color, size, shape) to incorporate additional information about data scales or groups.\nfaceting\nThe splitting up of the data into multiple subplots, or facets, to examine different groups within the data.\na theme\nAdditional controls on the “finer points” of the plot aesthetics, (e.g. font type, background, color scheme).\nEXAMPLE\nIn the NYT graphic, the data was mapped to the plot as follows:\n\n\nframe: x-axis = date, y-axis = temp\n\nlayers: add one line per year, add dots for each month in 2023\n\nscales: color each line by decade\n\nfaceting: none\n\na theme: NYT style\n\n6.2.3 ggplot + R packages\nWe will use the powerful ggplot tools in R to build (most of) our viz. The gg here is short for the “grammar of graphics”. These tools are developed in a way that:\n\nrecognizes that code is communication (it has a grammar!)\nconnects code to the components / philosophy of data viz\n\nEXAMPLES: ggplot in the News\n\n\nMPR journalist David Montgomery: R data viz\n\nBBC R data viz\n\nTo use these tools, we must first get them into R/RStudio! Recall that R is open source. Anybody can build R tools and share them through special R packages. The tidyverse package compiles a set of individual packages, including ggplot2, that share a common grammar and structure. Though the learning curve can be steep, this grammar is intuitive and generalizable once mastered. Image source: Posit BBC on X\n\nFollow the directions below to install this package, the directions depending upon whether or not you’re working on Mac’s server. Unless the authors of a package add updates, you only need to do this once all semester. To install:\n\n\nIf you’re working on Mac’s RStudio servertidyverse is already installed on the server! Check this 2 ways.\n\nType library(tidyverse) in your console. If you don’t get an error, it’s installed!\nCheck that it appears in the list under the “Packages” tab (bottom right pane).\n\n\n\nIf you’re working with a desktop version of R/RStudio\nIn the “Packages” tab (bottom right pane), click “Install”. From there type the name of the package (tidyverse), make sure the “Install dependencies” box is checked, and click “Install”.",

    "text": "6.3 Exercises\nExercise 1: Research Questions\nLet’s dig into the hikes data, starting with the elevation and difficulty ratings of the hikes:\n\nhead(hikes)\n\n             peak elevation difficulty ascent length time    rating\n1     Mt. Marcy        5344          5   3166   14.8 10.0  moderate\n2 Algonquin Peak       5114          5   2936    9.6  9.0  moderate\n3   Mt. Haystack       4960          7   3570   17.8 12.0 difficult\n4   Mt. Skylight       4926          7   4265   17.9 15.0 difficult\n5 Whiteface Mtn.       4867          4   2535   10.4  8.5      easy\n6       Dix Mtn.       4857          5   2800   13.2 10.0  moderate\n\n\n\nWhat features would we like a visualization of the categorical difficulty rating variable to capture?\nWhat about a visualization of the quantitative elevation variable?\nExercise 2: Load tidyverse\nWe’ll address the above questions using ggplot tools. Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\n# Use the ggplot function\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. Mainly, we’ve installed the package but need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nExercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category?\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe?\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function?The data\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating?\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!?\nExercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots. We’re just exploring ggplot.\n\n\n# Make a bar graph\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n#Label x an y axis\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# Add a color or fill the bar graph\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# Makes the boundaries orange \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# Changes the theme of the graph \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nExercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up\nPart a\nReflect on the ggplot() code.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the +? When do we use it?- Use it to add a new command\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”?- Use it to add a bar graph\nWhat does labs() stand for? - Use it to add the axis or dimensions\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? - color changes boundaries and fill fills in the bar graph\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe?\ndifficult\neasy\nmoderate\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others?\nSome categories are more common than others\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\n\nMost hikes in the Adirondacks are moderate in rating and the only a few hikes are difficult in the given data\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.\nThe categories are not orderd by difficulty\nExercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)? It is ordered in clumps\nWhat’s a typical elevation?\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\nEach x value would be its own category and it would be too many\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?\n6\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?\n1+1 = 2\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical?\n\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\n\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\n\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.\nExercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation))+\n  geom_histogram(color= \"black\", fill = \"blue\")\n\nExercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\n\n# makes a histogram\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n# makes the outline white \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") \n\n\n# Fills in the bars with blue \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"blue\") \n\n\n# Labels the axis \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# Increases the size of the \"containers/bins\" to include the numbers in \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# reduce the size of the bins\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# Change size of bins to 200\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\nExercise 10: Histogram Follow-up\n\nWhat function added the histogram layer / geometry?\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill?\nWhy does adding color = \"white\" improve the visualization?\nWhat did binwidth do?\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)?\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too small (e.g. 5 feet)?\nExercise 11: Density Plots\nDensity plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\nQuestions\n\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\")\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\")\n\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range?\nExercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each?\nExercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why?\n\n\n# YUCK\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\nlabs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why?\n\n\n# YUCK \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\nExercise 14: Practice\nPart a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://ajohns24.github.io/data/112/about_us_2024.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nPart b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck → Commit → Push\n\n\n\nWhen done, don’t forgot to click Render Book and check the resulting HTML files. If happy, jump to GitHub Desktop and commit the changes with the message Finish activity 3 and push to GitHub. Wait few seconds, then visit your portfolio website and make sure the changes are there.",

Notice that:\n\nboth variables are quantitative, and get their own axes\nthe response variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how repub_pct_20 might be predicted by repub_pct_16, not vice versa\n\nTry to replicate this using ggplot(). THINK:\n\nWhat info do you need to set up the canvas?\nWhat geometric layer (geom_???) might add these dots / points for each county? We haven’t learned this yet, just take some guesses.\n\n\n\n ggplot(elections, aes(y=repub_pct_20,x=repub_pct_16))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables\nRun each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs repub_pct_16 with different glyphs representing each county.

Be sure to comment on:\n\nthe strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\nthe direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\noutliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?)\nThe is a strong positve between republican support in 2020 and 2016, with a few outliers such as counties in Texas that seem to have dispproportinateyly higher republican support in 2020 than 2016\nExercise 4: Visualizing trend\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\nPart a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age.\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent - There seems to a weak negetive relationship between support in 2020 and median rent - This is a better predictor\nggplot(elections, aes(y=repub_pct_20,x=median_rent))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age- There seems to be no relationship between the two \nggplot(elections, aes(y=repub_pct_20,x=median_age))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?) - Scatter plot works beste when both are quantitative\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states. - Red historical has the highest median and blue has the lowest\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of repub_pct_20 alone, to re-create this image.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n# What does scale_fill_manual do?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# What does alpha = 0.5 do?\n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# What does facet_wrap do?!\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# Why is this terrible?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\nExercise 10\nWe’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\nWhich do you like best?\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots?\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots?\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nFinally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\nConstruct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# How are the \"historical\" and \"winner_20\" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\nPart a\nName one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options.\nPart b\nWhat’s your favorite bar plot from part and why?\nExercise 13: Practice (now or later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide\n\n\n\nDecide what’s best for you:\n\nTry this extra practice now.\nReflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).\n\n\n\nImport some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:\n\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\")\n\nConstruct plots that address the research questions in each chunk. You might make multiple plots–there are many ways to do things!. However, don’t just throw spaghetti at the wall.\nReflect before doing anything. What types of variables are these? How might you plot just 1 of the variables, and then tweak the plot to incorporate the other?\n\n# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?\n\n\n# How might we predict the 3pm temperature (temp3pm) by the 9am temperature (temp9am)?\n\n\n# How do the number of rainy days (raintoday) differ by location?",

    "text": "7.2 Exercises (optional)\nThe above visualizations are foundational and important. But they’re not the only way to visualize the variables in our dataset.\nOptional Exercise 1: Many Categories\nSuppose we wanted to better understand how the 2020 Republican support varied from county to county within each state. Since repub_pct_20 is quantitative and state_abbr is categorical, we could make a density plot of repub_pct_20 for each state. Reflect on why this is bad.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning: Groups with fewer than two data points have been dropped.\n\n\nWarning in max(ids, na.rm = TRUE): no non-missing arguments to max; returning\n-Inf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA facet wrap would also be bad!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_wrap(~ state_abbr)\n\nWarning: Groups with fewer than two data points have been dropped.\n\n\nWarning in max(ids, na.rm = TRUE): no non-missing arguments to max; returning\n-Inf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we want to compare the distribution of some quantitative outcome among many groups / categories, a ridgeline plot can be a good option. These are also called joy plots, named after the album cover for “Unknown Pleasures” by Joy Division. (Look it up!) To make a ridgeline plot, we can use the geom_density_ridges() function from the ggridges package.\n\n# Install ggridges package\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\n# Make our first joy plot\n# THINK: What DON'T you like about this?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density_ridges()\n\n\n# Let's put the states in order by Republican support, not alphabet\n# How do you think fct_reorder works?

The least?\nWhat other interesting patterns do you notice?\nDoes this plot prompt any other questions?\nOptional Exercise 2: Total Outcomes by State\nLet’s import some new data and counts up the total votes (Republican and Democratic) by state, not county. This was wrangled from the elections data!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\n\nFor example, we might make a scatterplot of the 2020 vs 2016 outcomes:\n\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUT this isn’t the easiest way to communicate or identify the changes from 1 year to the next.\n\n# YOU TRY\n# Start by creating a \"scatterplot\" of state_abbr (y-axis) by 2020 Republican support on the x-axis\n# Color the points red\n# Scroll to solutions below when you're ready\n\n\n# Check it out\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# YOU TRY\n# Reorder the states in terms of their 2020 Republican support (not alphabet)\n# Scroll to solutions below when you're ready\n\n\n# Check it out\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Finally, add ANOTHER layer of points for the 2016 outcomes\n# What info does this new geom_point() layer need to run?\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\") + \n  geom_point(aes(x = repub_pct_16, y = state_abbr))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect on the following\n\nWhat do you think this plot needs? Try it! You might need to do some digging online.\nSummarize the main takeaways from the plots. Which states changed the most from 2016 to 2020? The least? Where did the Republican support increase? Where did it decrease?\nWhat other questions are you left with?",

There, they range from ~10 to ~45 with a typical temp around ~30 degrees.\nTemperatures tend to be lowest in Hobart. There, they range from ~5 to ~45 with a typical temp around ~15 degrees.\nWollongong temps are in between and are the least variable from day to day.\n\nSUBTLETIES: Defining fill or color by a variable\nHow we define the fill or color depends upon whether we’re defining it by a named color or by some variable in our dataset. For example:\n\ngeom___(fill = \"blue\")named colors are defined outside the aesthetics and put in quotes\ngeom___(aes(fill = variable)) or ggplot(___, aes(fill = variable))\ncolors/fills defined by a variable are defined inside the aesthetics\nExample 3\nLet’s consider Wollongong alone:\n\n# Don't worry about the syntax (we'll learn it soon)\nwoll &lt;- weather |&gt;\n  filter(location == \"Wollongong\") |&gt; \n  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  \n\n\n# How often does it raintoday?\n# Fill your geometric layer with the color blue.\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday)) +\n  geom_bar(fill=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# If it does raintoday, what does this tell us about raintomorrow?\n# Use your intuition first\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday))+ \n  geom_bar(aes(fill=raintomorrow))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now compare different approaches\n\n# Default: stacked bars\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Side-by-side bars\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Proportional bars\n# position = \"fill\" refers to filling the frame, nothing to do with the color-related fill\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\nThere’s often not one “best plot”, but a combination of plots that provide a complete picture:\n\nThe stacked and side-by-side bars reflect that on most days, it does not rain.\nThe proportional / filled bars lose that information, but make it easier to compare proportions: it’s more likely to rain tomorrow if it also rains today.\nExample 4\nConstruct a plot that illustrates how 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) vary by date in Wollongong. Represent each day on the plot and use a curve/line to help highlight the trends.\n\n# THINK: What variable goes on the y-axis?\n# For the curve, try adding span = 0.5 to tweak the curvature\n\n\n# Instead of a curve that captures the general TREND,\n# draw a line that illustrates the movement of RAW temperatures from day to day\n# NOTE: We haven't learned this geom yet! Guess.\nggplot(woll, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: A line plot isn’t always appropriate! It can be useful in situations like this, when our data are chronological.\nReflection\nThere’s a seasonal / cyclic behavior in temperatures – they’re highest in January (around 23 degrees) and lowest in July (around 16 degrees). There are also some outliers – some abnormally hot and cold days.",

    "text": "8.2 New Stuff\nNext, let’s consider the entire weather data for all 3 locations. The addition of location adds a 3rd variable into our research questions:\n\nHow does the relationship between raintoday and raintomorrow vary by location?\nHow does the behavior of temp3pm over date vary by location?\nAnd so on.\n\nThus far, we’ve focused on the following components of a plot:\n\nsetting up a frame\n\nadding layers / geometric elements\nsplitting the plot into facets for different groups / categories\nchange the theme, e.g. axis labels, color, fill\n\nWe’ll have to think about all of this, along with scales. Scales change the color, fill, size, shape, or other properties according to the levels of a new variable. This is different than just assigning scale by, for example, color = \"blue\".\nWork on the examples below in your groups. Check in with your intuition! We’ll then discuss as a group as relevant.\nExample 5\n\n# Plot temp3pm vs temp9am\n# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am)) + \n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds\n# AND identify the days on which it rained / didn't raintoday\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am)) + \n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How many ways can you think to make that plot of temp3pm vs temp9am with info about location and rain?\n# Play around!\n\nExample 6\n\n# Change the code in order to construct a line plot of temp3pm vs date for each separate location (no points!)\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date)) + \n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n# Plot the relationship of raintomorrow & raintoday\n# Change the code in order to indicate this relationship by location\nggplot(weather, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Not Get Overwhelmed?\n\n\n\nThere’s no end to the number and type of visualizations you could make. And it’s important to not just throw spaghetti at the wall until something sticks. FlowingData shows that one dataset can be visualized many ways, and makes good recommendations for data viz workflow, which we modify and build upon here:\n\nIdentify simple research questions.\nWhat do you want to understand about the variables or the relationships among them?\n\nStart with the basics and work incrementally.\n\nIdentify what variables you want to include in your plot and what structure these have (eg: categorical, quantitative, dates)\nStart simply. Build a plot of just 1 of these variables, or the relationship between 2 of these variables.\nSet up a plotting frame and add just one geometric layer at a time.\nStart tweaking: add whatever new variables you want to examine,\n\n\n\nAsk your plot questions.\n\nWhat questions does your plot answer? What questions are left unanswered by your plot?\nWhat new questions does your plot spark / inspire?\nDo you have the viz tools to answer these questions, or might you learn more?\n\n\nFocus.\nReporting a large number of visualizations can overwhelm the audience and obscure your conclusions. Instead, pick out a focused yet comprehensive set of visualizations.",

(Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)\n\nThe Sat scores range from around 100 to 1100, the most typical outcomes is around 900 and another smaller peak at around 1300- Student either get high scores ar low scores\nExercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries\nThe first question we’d like to answer is: Can the variability in sat scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (expend) and typical teacher salary?\nPart a\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs expend\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(x=expend, y = sat )) + \n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(x=salary, y = sat )) + \n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhat are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you?\n-They both have a negative weak relationship with sat scores. The higher the salary and expenditure, the lower the sat scores this is quite weird\nExercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries\nConstruct one visualization of the relationship of sat with salary and expend. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!\n\nggplot(education, aes(x=salary, y= sat, color = expend )) +\n  geom_point()+\n   geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: The following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation:\ncolour.\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale\nIt can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to discretize a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into categories.\nConstruct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what’s happening here. What happens if you change “2” to “3”?\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 2))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\nDescribe the trivariate relationship between sat, salary, and expend.\n\nLower expenditure, lower salary equal higher sat and higher salary and higher expenditure has lower sat scores\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\nIt’s strange that SAT scores seem to decrease with spending. But we’re leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state’s students that actually take the SAT. The fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\nPart a\nBuild a univariate viz of fracCat to better understand how many states fall into each category.\n\nggplot(education, aes(x=fracCat))+\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBuild 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between sat and fracCat. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?\n\nggplot(education, aes(x=sat, color = fracCat ))+\n  geom_density(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nMake a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of sat with expend AND fracCat. Highlight the differences in fracCat groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell?\nDoes it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?\n\nggplot(education, aes(x=expend, y = sat, color = fracCat ))+\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart d\nPutting all of this together, explain this example of Simpson’s Paradox. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the opposite is true?\n\nThe fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\nThere is an addition of controll b only including the rpecentage of people that only take the Sat score, hence the rel;ationship is now positive\n\n-Simpson’s paradox is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.",

    "text": "8.4 Exercises (optional)\nExercise 6: Heat Maps\nAs usual, we’ve only just scratched the surface! There are lots of other data viz techniques for exploring multivariate relationships. Let’s start with a heat map.\nPart a\nRun the chunks below. Check out the code, but don’t worry about every little detail! NOTES:\n\nThis is not part of the ggplot() grammar, making it a bit complicated.\nIf you’re curious about what a line in the plot does, comment it out (#) and check out what happens!\nIn the plot, for each state (row), each variable (column) is scaled to indicate whether the state has a relative high value (yellow), a relatively low value (purple), or something in between (blues/greens).\nYou can also play with the color scheme. Type ?cm.colors in the console to learn about various options.\nWe’ll improve the plot later, so don’t spend too much time trying to learn something from this plot.\n\n\n# Remove the \"State\" column and use it to label the rows\n# Then scale the variables\nplot_data &lt;- education |&gt; \n  column_to_rownames(\"State\") |&gt; \n  data.matrix() |&gt; \n  scale()\n\n# Load the gplots package needed for heatmaps\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n# Construct heatmap 1\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = NA, \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 2\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = TRUE,             ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM NA TO TRUE\n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 3\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"row\",       ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM \"none\" TO \"row\"\n  Rowv = TRUE,            \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\nPart b\nIn the final two plots, the states (rows) are rearranged by similarity with respect to these education metrics. The final plot includes a dendrogram which further indicates clusters of similar states. In short, states that have a shorter path to connection are more similar than others.\nPutting this all together, what insight do you gain about the education trends across U.S. states? Which states are similar? In what ways are they similar? Are there any outliers with respect to 1 or more of the education metrics?\nExercise 7: Star plots\nLike heat maps, star plots indicate the relative scale of each variable for each state. Thus, we can use star maps to identify similar groups of states, and unusual states!\nPart a\nConstruct and check out the star plot below. Note that each state has a “pie”, with each segment corresponding to a different variable. The larger a segment, the larger that variable’s value is in that state. For example:\n\nCheck out Minnesota. How does Minnesota’s education metrics compare to those in other states? What metrics are relatively high? Relatively low?\nWhat states appear to be similar? Do these observations agree with those that you gained from the heat map?\n\n\nstars(plot_data,\n  flip.labels = FALSE,\n  key.loc = c(10, 1.5),\n  cex = 1, \n  draw.segments = TRUE\n)\n\nPart b\nFinally, let’s plot the state stars by geographic location! What new insight do you gain here?!\n\nstars(plot_data,\n  flip.labels = FALSE,\n  locations = data.matrix(as.data.frame(state.center)),  # added external data to arrange by geo location\n  key.loc = c(-110, 28),\n  cex = 1, \n  draw.segments = TRUE\n)",

Those same states tend to have higher SAT scores because of the self-selection of who participates.\nExercise 6: Heat Maps\nPart a\n\n# Remove the \"State\" column and use it to label the rows\n# Then scale the variables\nplot_data &lt;- education |&gt; \n  column_to_rownames(\"State\") |&gt; \n  data.matrix() |&gt; \n  scale()\n\n# Load the gplots package needed for heatmaps\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'gplots'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    lowess\n\n# Construct heatmap 1\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = NA, \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 2\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = TRUE,             ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM NA TO TRUE\n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 3\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"row\",       ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM \"none\" TO \"row\"\n  Rowv = TRUE,            \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\n\nSimilar values in verbal, math, and sat.\nHigh contrast (an inverse relationship) verbal/math/sat scores and the fraction of students that take the SAT.\nOutliers of Utah and California in ratio (more students per teacher).\nWhile grouped, fraction and salary are not as similar to each other as the sat scores; it is also interesting to notice states that have high ratios have generally low expenditures per student.\nExercise 7: Star Plots\nPart a\nMN is high on the SAT performance related metrics and low on everything else.
